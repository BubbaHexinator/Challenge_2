As a young professional I have slowly been more interetested in my financials. One problem that always seem to occur for me personaly was applying for a loan. Not so much how to apply but the steps banks use to verify and accept an application. I wanted to come up with a user friendly way a bank would be able to print if a applicant is illegible for a loan based on certain perameters.  So i needed to come up with a user story that would allow me get straight to the point: I wanted to create a tool that would allow a user, in this case a lender,  to to determine if a certain applicaant was approved for a loan and if so which loan.   The main problem that inspired me to do this was the lack of user friendly financial interfaces on the market that gave the user a qick answer for a loan approval. This tool needed to be cost friendly for them and affordable for the developer to make. After much time and planning I came up with my very own Loan Financial Qualifying program. This program allows a user to input a list of variables at which the end lets the user know a list of potential qualififying loans the applicant is approved for. Alas if the user is flaged a negative response the program will not provide a list of loans available for the user.
